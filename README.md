# Reduction

The project aims to implement various versions of the reduction sum algorithm.
The main reference being the Reduction.pdf by Mark Harris.

The slaient features that are explored in this project are as under:

1.  Understand and implement different types of reduction sum techniques.
2.  Implement reduction using various features of CUDA such as shared memory, etc.
3.  Study memory coalescing, bank conflicts, etc.

Further additions shall be added in due course ..
